ChainFusion tackles financial exclusion by offering a decentralized, cross-chain platform that enables low-cost, fast remittances and token swaps. It integrates NFT royalties for creators, empowering them with rewards. The platform supports unbanked populations through mobile money conversions, while its DAO governance ensures community-driven decision-making. Using tools like Wormhole and Raydium, it offers cross-border payments with seamless integration.
